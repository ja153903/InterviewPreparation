If that's true, then we've found the correct pair of indices to return.

As usual with DFS, the search visits every node of the graph exactly once, declining to revisit any node that has already been visited. Thus, the collection of search trees is a spanning forest of the graph. The strongly connected components will be recovered as certain subtrees of this forest. The roots of these subtress are called the roots of the strongly connected components. Any node of a strongly connected component might server as a root, if it happens to be the first node of a component that is discovered by search."
